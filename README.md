The DOM Challenge
Project Description
This project is a simple web page that demonstrates various DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation techniques using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The project showcases how the DOM can be used to create dynamic and interactive web experiences.

Features
Interactive elements that respond to user input.
Demonstration of how to modify HTML elements using JavaScript.
Styling applied using both CSS and JavaScript-based DOM manipulation.
Basic DOM events, event listeners, and element manipulation.
Technologies Used
HTML: Structure of the web page.
CSS: Styling and layout of the page.
JavaScript: DOM manipulation and user interaction.

Features Breakdown
DOM Selection: Various elements are selected and manipulated using JavaScript methods like querySelector(), getElementById(), and getElementsByClassName().
Event Handling: Buttons and input fields trigger actions such as changing styles, modifying content, or responding to user interactions.
Dynamic Content: JavaScript dynamically adds, modifies, or removes elements from the HTML.
Future Improvements
Add more complex DOM manipulation examples, such as animations or interactive forms.
Improve the UI with additional CSS styling and effects.
Add more detailed comments to the code to explain each function.
